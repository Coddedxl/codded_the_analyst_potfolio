  <h1>About Us</h1>

With a strong foundation in data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis, I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive informed decision-making. My analytical journey has been shaped by hands-on experience with tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, power bi, and Tableau, and I continuously seek opportunities to deepen my expertise in data storytelling and business intelligence.
Though currently seeking employment, I remain committed to professional growth through personal projects, online learning, and collaborative initiatives. My portfolio reflects a diverse range of analytical work—from hospital referral pattern analysis to sales performance dashboards—demonstrating my ability to work with complex datasets across industries.</p>
