  <p>Key Projects & What I Did<p>
üè• Healthcare Sector
Project: Hospital Referral Pattern Analysis
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NetworkX, Matplotlib
Objective:
To analyze how patients are referred between departments in a hospital, identify bottlenecks, and optimize referral pathways.
Steps I Took:

- Imported raw hospital referral data using Pandas.
- Handled missing values, standardized department names, and removed duplicates.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Used groupings and counts to identify the most frequent referral sources and destinations.
- Analyzed referral volume over time to detect seasonal or operational trends.
- Network Visualization:
- Built a directed graph using NetworkX to represent referral flows between departments.
- Applied centrality metrics to identify key departments acting as hubs or bottlenecks.
- Insight Generation:
- Found departments with unusually high inbound referrals but low outbound activity.
- Suggested operational changes to balance workload and improve patient flow.
What Employers Learn About You:
